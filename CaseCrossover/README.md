Case Crossover 

The code and description below outlines the steps for conducting a gradient boosted machine approach using the XGboost package in R. Briefly:

Gradient boosting is a supervised machine learning approach in which regression or classification trees are sequentially built from the prediction errors of the prior tree.
GBM algorithms allow for complex, nonlinear relationships among predictor and outcome variables and collinearity between predictors, making them well suited for ecological analyses.
Extreme gradient boosting is a scalable and efficient GBM implementation that minimizes overfitting and has been shown to achieve high predictive accuracy.
